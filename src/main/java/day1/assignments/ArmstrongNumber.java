	 * Shortcuts:
	 * 1) Print : type: syso, followed by: ctrl + space + enter
	 * 2) To create a While loop, type 'while' followed by: ctrl + space + down arrow + enter
	 * 3) To create an 'if' condition: type 'if', followed by ctrl + space +down arrow + enter
	 *   
	 * What are my learnings from this code?
